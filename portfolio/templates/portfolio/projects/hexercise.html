                Hexercise is a game project developed by me and 5 other students as part of our Digital Arts and
                Entertainment
                education at Howest Kortrijk. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The game was developped for our client, <a href="https://sportinnovatiecampus.be/">Sport Innovatie
                Campus</a>, who wanted a new variation of game to be
                played in their sports center, where they previously already had single player kinect games.<br>
                The goal for our project was to create a multiplayer, ideally versus game that incentivises movement,
                competition
                and fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is a 1v1 versus game where you cast spells at each other to try and win.
                the casting of spells happens using kinect body trackers<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I mainly worked on the calibration & cleaning of the kinect input, making sure the input
                is smooth and that the player could be centered in the playfield no matter what the camera
                setup is.<br>
